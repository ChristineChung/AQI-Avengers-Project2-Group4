## Project Overview
The aim of our project is to discover trends in air pollution in New York City (NYC) and Long Island (LI) by analyzing the Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the past two years. Additionally, we will predict the AQI for the upcoming year using machine learning models. This analysis will provide valuable insights for individuals, especially those in sensitive groups (such as children, elderly people, and those with respiratory conditions), helping them to understand when it is safe to go outside and when they should take precautions.

## Detailed Project Description
### Background
Air pollution is a significant environmental issue that affects millions of people worldwide. In urban areas like New York City (NYC), the air quality can fluctuate dramatically due to various factors such as traffic emissions, industrial activities, and weather conditions. Poor air quality has been linked to a range of health problems, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues, and adverse effects on children and the elderly.
New York City, one of the most densely populated cities in the United States, faces unique challenges related to air pollution. The city's extensive network of roads, high vehicle density, numerous industrial operations, and seasonal weather variations contribute to the complexity of its air quality dynamics. Monitoring and predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) is crucial for public health and safety, particularly for sensitive groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.

### Motivation
Understanding the trends and patterns in air pollution can help policymakers and health officials implement better strategies to improve air quality. By predicting future AQI levels, we can provide timely warnings to vulnerable populations, helping them make informed decisions about outdoor activities. This project aims to contribute to public health awareness and support efforts to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution.

## Data Sources
The AQI data for New York City has been sourced from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
